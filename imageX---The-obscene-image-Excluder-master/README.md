                                                               #PROJECT – imageX (Obscene image Excluder) APP 	

This project idea is based on creating a Cyber Security Tool which by default won’t let any OBSCENE image to be saved in the Phone’s Memory.
This is basically a camera application when used to click pictures will predict if the image is obscene or not and then do the further processing.
	  If image is found to be obscene => Not - saved
	                      Not Obscene => Saved
Acknowledgement text --> user’s guardian (if an Unsafe image is clicked)
The app will only initiate after fetching contact details of guardian.

Implementation

Implementation is the stage of a project during which theory is turned into practice. The major steps involved in this phase are:
Acquisition and Installation of Hardware and Software: The hardware and the relevant software required for running the system must be made fully operational before implementation.
Conversion: The data from the old system needs to be converted to operate in the new format of the new system. The database needs to be setup with security and recovery procedures fully defined.
User Training: During this phase, all the programs of the system are loaded onto the user’s computer. After loading the system, training of the user starts. Main topics of such type of training are:
•	How to execute the package?
•	How to enter the data?
•	How to process the data (processing details)?
•	How take out the reports?

After the users are trained about the system, working has to shift from manual to computerized working. The process is called Changeover.

Maintenance

Maintenance is necessary to eliminate errors in the system during its working life and to tune the system to any variations in its working environments. It has been seen that there are always some errors found in the systems that must be noted and corrected. The review of the system is done for:
•	knowing the full capabilities of the system
•	knowing the required changes or the additional requirements

                                                                  	Future Scope and Enhancements

Since we are in the initial stages of the application, we are soon going to roll out some amazing features like time management and screen report which will help the user to have a judicious use of their device. Another feature we really look forward to is the tool that blocks pornography and obscene material from the user’s device.
This will help the user have a safe surf while using the device. The location feature will enable the guardian to have the user’s location after every specific time interval as set by the guardian. We really look forward to make the app a one stop app for parental controls.
The app being in its very initial stages has a lot more to offer in the future updates:
•	In the future updates we plan to roll out some amazing features in the app
•	To integrate this tool in all phone camera and other camera using applications in the device
•	It is still a prototype but we dare you to test it out!
•	Features like time management and decency in order to have a healthy eyesight
•	Block pornography and obscene content from around the web
•	Providing location updates and Wi-Fi management to the guardian
•	Adding attractive filters in the camera application

Built as a project for the GPCSSI-2020 under the guidance of Mr. Rakshit Tandon.
